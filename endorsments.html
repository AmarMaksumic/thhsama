                Incumbent Democratic Congressman Max Rose represents New York‚Äôs 11th Congressional District, which encompasses Staten Island and South Brooklyn. He is the second Democratic candidate to hold that seat and the first to unseat an incumbent Republican since 1981. He single handedly turned the most conservative NY District ‚Äúblue‚Äù, and has continued to serve his people every single day since then. In 2012, Max served as an active duty officer in Afghanistan and earned a Bronze Star, Purple Heart, and Combat Infantry Badge. He then  went on to work as Director of Public Engagement and Special Assistant to the late Brooklyn District Attorney Ken Thompson and later became Chief of Staff for Brightpoint Health, a non-profit healthcare organization. During his Congressional term, he focused on improving transportation in his district, fighting the opioid crisis, making healthcare more affordable for veterans, and uprooting corruption in Washington. As the first post-9/11 veteran to represent New York City, Max currently serves on the House Committee on Homeland Security, the House Committee on Veterans‚Äô Affairs, and the National Guard. He is a no-nonsense candidate that does not play by political party or by political gain, but instead prioritizes serving and properly representing his constituents. Take it to the polls, vote Rose!

                Medicare/ Medicaid / etc. üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è
                <br><br>
                Max will always fight cuts to Medicare and Medicaid, which our seniors and people with disabilities rely on. As a former healthcare executive who ran non-profit community health centers in our district, Max understands what it takes to reform our healthcare system to make it more affordable and more accessible. In Congress, he is working with both Republicans and Democrats to move bipartisan ideas that will lower costs and moves us towards universal coverage, while moving beyond the poisonous debates we‚Äôve been having for the past ten years.
                <br>
                He‚Äôs also working to ensure that patients can afford to access the life-saving medications they need and isn‚Äôt afraid to take on pharmaceutical corporations to do it. When corporations like Mylan jack up the price of an EpiPen by 400% without a thought‚Äîor consequence‚Äîthere is something seriously wrong.
                <br>
                Max‚Äôs bill, the More Help for Seniors Act, passed the House as part of comprehensive drug pricing reform legislation that would have Medicare finally start negotiating the cost of prescription drugs. Max‚Äôs bill would take some of the savings from negotiation and use them to lower costs for seniors even more. The comprehensive bill, the Lower Drug Costs Now Act, was historic legislation that lowers drug prices for all Americans, creates a new out-of-pocket limit on prescription drug costs for Medicare beneficiaries, reinvests savings so that we can create new breakthrough treatments and cures, and provide $10 billion in funding to combat the opioid epidemic.
                <br>
                Max also helped pass the¬†Patient Protection and Affordable Care Enhancement Act to lower health costs and improve accessibility for all Americans.¬†The bill significantly increases the Affordable Care Act‚Äôs affordability subsidies¬†to be more generous and cover more middle-class families.¬†For the first time, no person will have to pay more than 8.5 percent of their income for a quality plan in the healthcare marketplace, and many Americans will see their premiums cut in half or more
                <br><br>
                COVID-19 üò∑ 
                <br><br>
                Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, and have made sure that Staten Island University Hospital (SIUH) be awarded $32.3 million
                <br>
                Congressman Max Rose today joined bipartisan Members of Congress from the Problem Solvers Caucus to unveil its ‚ÄúMarch To Common Ground‚Äù framework to help break the gridlock on the latest COVID-19 relief package and encourage negotiators to get back to the table. The package addresses key areas of need, including COVID-19 testing, unemployment insurance, direct stimulus, worker and liability protection, small business and non-profit support, food security, schools and child care, housing, election support, and state and local aid.The framework calls for allocating resources to the following key categories:
                <br>
                * Testing & Healthcare ($100B)
                * Direct Assistance to Individuals & Families ($316B)
                * Unemployment Assistance ($120B)
                * Small Business & Non-profit Support ($290B)
                * Schools & Child Care ($145B)
                * State & Local Aid ($500.3B)
                * Election Support ($400B)
                * Broadband, Agriculture, USPS, & Census ($52B)
                * Worker & Liability Protections¬†
                * Automatic Boosters & Reducers
                <br>
                Our NYPD officers, firefighters, and EMTs have put their lives on the line during the COVID-19 pandemic since day one. That‚Äôs why Max introduced legislation which passed in the House of Representatives to ensure public safety officers who contract the coronavirus while on duty are eligible to receive death and disability benefits, without unnecessary legal hurdles. Max ultimately worked with House leadership and the Senate to see the Safeguarding America‚Äôs First Responders Act signed into law by President Trump this year.
                <br><br>
                Economy of COVID-19  üò∑ üíµ 
                <br><br>
                During these times I‚Äôve sponsored a bill that would ensure that all children of essential workers who died or were injured while working during the coronavirus pandemic are eligible to receive federal benefits to attend a college or technical program of their choice. These benefits is the least we could do to help the families that have helped keep our country going in the midst of a pandemic.
                <br>
                Just a few weeks ago, I along with 49 other Representatives, 25 democrats and 25 republicans, announced a new, bipartisan $2 trillion covid relief bill. Though it was struck down, conversation has begun and I will not stop until this gets passed. We cannot work on equal rights and infrastructure, until we have defeated this health crisis. 
                <br>
                ‚Äú To support small businesses during these times I am leading the charge to pass the Real Economic Support That Acknowledges Unique Restaurant Assistance Needed to Survive (RESTAURANTS) Act. This act to establish a restaurant grant program designed to help small restaurants deal with the long-term challenges of COVID-19, and ensure they can re-employ workers and stay in business.‚Äù
                <br>
                After hearing from several Little League coaches and youth sports leaders on Staten Island and in South Brooklyn struggling to stay afloat amidst the pandemic, Max not only took on the New York City Parks Department and won, but he also introduced the COVID-19 Youth Sports and Healthy Working Families Relief Act. This comprehensive, bipartisan legislation would give working families a tax break, and ensure our kids‚Äô teams can survive through the year.¬†

                Opioid Crisis üß™
                <br><br>
                One of Max‚Äôs top priorities is combating the opioid epidemic that has hit our community so hard. Max‚Äôs bipartisan bill, the Fentanyl Sanctions Act, passed both the House and Senate and was signed into law by the president as part of National Defense Authorization Act. It imposes sanctions on drug manufactures in China and other nations who produce illicit opioids for traffickers, and on transnational criminal organizations like those in Mexico who traffic fentanyl into the U.S. and as well as on financial institutions that assist them
                <br>
                As Chief of Staff at Brightpoint Health, Max helped working people get healthcare they could afford. He knows firsthand how underserved our community is when it comes to these vital services, and has taken active steps to address this issue, including helping bring a medical clinic and drug recovery center to the Island. The opioid crisis has hit our community hard, and Max has been a leader in doing whatever it takes to save lives and get patients who are struggling with addiction the care so they need return to a productive life. He‚Äôs focused expanding access to treatment and renewing our focus on prevention.
                <br>
                Passing Bills for Better Healthcare and Benefits for Veterans
                Max is a proud cosponsor of multiple pieces of legislation, including the Burn Pits Accountability Act and the Veteran Treatment Court Coordination Act, that seek to protect veterans who have been exposed to toxic chemicals in the line of duty, and to make sure veterans receive the benefits that they deserve. As a member of the Health Subcommittee, he cosponsored the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act, and successfully worked to see the bill signed into law by President Trump, guaranteeing benefits for our heroes that were long overdue.¬†
                After hearing that a retired Staten Island veteran incurred an $18,000 debt because of a bureaucratic mix-up at the VA involving snail mail, Max grilled the VA at a committee hearing, and got the veteran‚Äôs debt successfully liquidated, with all payments refunded. To prevent any veteran from going through the same debt collection problems at VA, Max introduced the Stopping Harm and Implementing Enhanced Lead-time for Debts for Veterans (SHIELD) Act to hold the VA accountable for their payment practices.¬†
                <br>
                secured millions of dollars more to fight the opioid epidemic ($140 million in increased funding to combat the opioid crisis through prevention and treatment - and he led a bipartisan coalition of Congress to do it.)
                slapped China with sanctions for flooding our streets with fentanyl-->

                Demanded that Congress stop spending their time and our money trying to undo Roe v. Wade, and defended women‚Äôs right to make their own healthcare decisions
                <br>
                Max will protect public health through continued funding for Planned Parenthood, which provides much-needed health services to so many communities. He will fight any effort to restrict a woman‚Äôs right to choose.

        <p>Our beliefs vs. Their beliefs:</p>
        <p>
          <i class="fa fa-check"></i> Affordable Care Act - Max Rose has made his case clear; he supports a multi-payer healthcare system. This allows for individuals to choose the plan that works best for their needs. On top of that, his push to make Medicaid and Medicare <em>more accesible</em>, but not mandatory, aligns with our ideals. Rose has also advocated for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Enhancement Act which builds upon the idea of developing an affordable, multi-payer healthcare system.<br/>
          <i class="fa fa-check"></i> Lowering drug and medical treatment prices - Through his 'More Help for Seniors Act' and support for the 'Lower Drug Costs Now Act,' it is clear that Rose is looking out for the wallets of the people.<br/>
          <i class="fa fa-check"></i> COVID Response - Through his contribution to CARES (Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economy Security) Act and 'March To Common Ground' framework (more in his notes above), it is clear that Rose is the Man with the plan! In addition, Rose has funded the community through his 'bipartisan $2 trillion covid relief bill' and 'Real Economic Support That Acknowledges Unique Restaurant Assistance Needed to Survive (RESTAURANTS) Act.'<br/>

                I am Alexandria Ocasio Cortez and I am running for Congresswoman in the New York Congressional 14th District. I was inspired to run for office and support my community as I grew up experiencing the inequality in New York‚Äôs rising income. During my years in Boston University, I got the opportunity to work in the office of Senator Ted Kennedy.  It was while I was working that I witnessed first hand the harsh reality of families being separated by the ICE.  These experiences led me to organize the Latinx Youth in Bronx as well as working as an Educational Director with the National Hispanic Institute. This role allowed me to help my fellow Americans especially undocumented youth in college readiness and community leadership. In addition, during the financial crisis of 2008, my father passed away and I worked as a waitress to support my family. Ever since I swore in Congress in January 2019, I have committed myself to support the working middle class and advocate for the social, economic, racial, as well as environmental rights.

                Healthcare has become a main issue in our nation especially during this pandemic with COVID-19 and Alexandria Ocaiso-Cortez has a plan of action in order to address this. COVID-19 has put minorities, immigrants, undocumented people, and essential workers in a difficult position since they do not receive the necessary care and help. AOC focuses on the people and strives to protect their lives and livelihoods, which is why she was one of the only Democrats to vote against the interim deal on the coronavirus response. This deal would not have helped the local governments, small businesses, and the people who struggle to pay rent. AOC‚Äôs focus has continuously shown her determination for helping the working class and has displayed how she can be the representative they need. She believes healthcare is a human right  and everyone should have access to safe and affordable prescription medications. The Medicare for All Act would create a universal, single payer healthcare system, which would cover dental, mental, vision, women‚Äôs health, prescription drugs, and emergency room care. This would be a national healthcare system that not only provides medical attention, but would also lower the prices for drugs and medical treatments.

          <i class="fa fa-close"></i> Affordable Care Act - AOC supports Medicare for all, which is a single payer system; something that we are against. We have dropped out of the 'Medicare for All' oppositon coalition, yet we are still looking for ways to bolster our solution with the ACA rather than fight against Medicare for All.<br/>
          <i class="fa fa-check"></i> Lowering drug and medical treatment prices - Although AOC will do this through Medicare for all, we do support the effort to lower medical costs for patients.<br/>
          <i class="fa fa-check"></i> COVID Response - AOC has a realistic and executable plan for taking the pandemic head on.<br/>

                Donovan Richards is the Democratic nominee for Queens Borough President. He plans to continue his work from his time on City Council from 2013 to 2017 to improve Queens. He has served as the chair for Environmental Protection and Public Safety. He will create more criminal justice reform so it is not so racially biased, and part of this will include police reform. He will keep ICE out of courts so immigrants will not be unfairly treated there. Affordable housing is also a priority, as he will improve renter‚Äôs rights and hold landlords accountable. Finally, he will get more funding for small businesses in Queens which have been disproportionately hurt in this pandemic. It‚Äôs time Queens got the president it deserved. Vote Richards to make Queens richer!

                Kamala Harris is running for Democratic Vice Presidential nominee in the 2020 presidential election. Growing up Kamala looked up to role models like Thurgood Marshall, Constance Baker Motley, and Charles Hamilton Houston and learned what kind of person it takes to stand up to the powerful, and swore to spend her life advocating for those who could not defend themselves. Kamala went on to get an undergraduate degree from Howard University and a law degree from the University of California and from there she became non-stop. Following that Kamala went on to become the second African-American woman and first South Asian American in California to be elected Attorney General. One of her signature accomplishments as Attorney General was creating Open Justice, an online platform to make criminal justice data available to the public. The database helped improve police accountability by collecting information on the number of deaths and injuries of those in police custody. Overall, Kamala's mission started out as fighting for the rights of all communities in California, but now it has expanded into something much greater. Since taking office, she has introduced and cosponsored legislation to raise wages for working people, reform our broken criminal justice system, make healthcare a right for all Americans, address the epidemic of substance abuse, support veterans and military families, and expand access to childcare for working parents. Kamala Harris is a woman fighting and will keep on fighting for the American people.

                Joe Biden is running as the Democratic Presidential nominee in the 2020 presidential election! He is a proud member of the Democratic Party, a former senator of Delaware, and was elected Vice President of the United States alongside former president Barack Obama, and has been involved within the government for half a century! With government experience dating from 1970 to 2020, Joe Biden balances his busy campaign and professional life with his family. Joe plans on uplifting the needs of working- and middle-class Americans, and making sure everyone‚Äôs voices are heard in our democracy. Joe has been through a great deal of tragedy from his first wife and daughter passing away in a car crash, to his son, Beau, passing of brain cancer, which has only made Biden more compassionate and kind towards the general public, something that is clear within his own mission statements: We've got to rebuild the backbone of the country, we‚Äôve got to demonstrate respected leadership on the world stage, and finally, we've got to make sure our democracy includes everyone! As the 44th U.S. President said, "The best thing about Joe is that when we get everybody together, he really forces people to think and defend their positions, to look at things from every angle, and that is very valuable for me." During an incredibly difficult time under our current President, it is important now than ever to make the right choice on election day: Voting for Biden to unite for a better America!

                Good morning America! It's me, the greatest president of the decade. I am running for re-election against Silly Old Joe and I need your support to keep old senile men like him at mental facilities. For the last four years, I made America great again. Look at the stock markets, they are all at their all time highs. Look at Black and Hispanic unemployment rates, lowest of all time. I am a man for the people who was elected by the people. With your help, America can experience another four years of greatness, instead of the hell Silly Joe Biden is going to bring us. With my administration, we have the best employment rates, lowest taxes, greatest healthcare, and America is no longer being extorted by CHINA. Silly Joe will sell your rights overseas, while I will protect them within our own safe borders.
